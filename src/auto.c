#include "main.h"

/*
 * Runs the user autonomous code. This function will be started in its own task
 * with the default priority and stack size whenever the robot is enabled via the
 * Field Management System or the VEX Competition Switch in the autonomous mode.
 * If the robot is disabled or communications is lost, the autonomous task will
 * be stopped by the kernel. Re-enabling the robot will restart the task, not
 * re-start it from where it left off.
 *
 * Code running in the autonomous task cannot access information from the VEX
 * Joystick. However, the autonomous function can be invoked from another task if
 * a VEX Competition Switch is not
 * available, and it can access joystick information if called in this way.
 *
 * The autonomous task may exit, unlike operatorControl() which should never
 * exit. If it does so, the robot will await a switch to another mode or
 * disable/enable cycle.
