/*
 * Runs the user operator control code. This function will be started in its own
 * task with the default priority and stack size whenever the robot is enabled
 * via the Field Management System or the VEX Competition Switch in the operator
 * control mode. If the robot is disabled or communications is lost, the operator
 * control task will be stopped by the kernel. Re-enabling the robot will restart
 * the task, not resume it from where it left off.
 *
 * If no VEX Competition Switch or Field Management system is plugged in, the VEX
 * Cortex will run the operator control task. Be warned that this will also occur
 * if the VEX Cortex is tethered directly to a computer via the USB A to A cable
 * without any VEX Joystick attached.
 *
 * Code running in this task can take almost any action, as the VEX Joystick is
 * available and the scheduler is operational. However, proper use of delay() or
 * taskDelayUntil() is highly recommended to give other tasks (including system
 * tasks such as updating LCDs) time to run.
 *
 * This task should never exit; it should end with some kind of infinite loop,
 * even if empty.
